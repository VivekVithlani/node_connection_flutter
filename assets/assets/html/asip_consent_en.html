        By signing, you consent to the following terms:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The organization will complete the ASIP application on your behalf
            and share all personal information contained within the application
            with the Catholic Charities Diocese of San Diego (CCDSD), as well as
            the California Department of Social Services, the Office of Refugee
            Resettlement, or any other government agency as needed, for the

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The organization will make requests on your behalf to support your
            housing needs, including but not limited to the location where you
            will be permanently housed, and the rent amount.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If there are any changes to your approved ASIP plan, you will
            immediately contact CCDSD within three business days.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            CCDSD will contact you each month to confirm that you are still
            residing in the rental location in your ASIP application. It is
            imperative that you respond to CCDSD. If CCDSD cannot confirm that
            you are residing in this location, or you change locations without
            notifying CCDSD, subsequent payments may be terminated upon CCDSD's
            determination.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

        By signing, you indicate that you understand the following about the
        information you provide and its uses:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            I understand that Title 18, Section 1001 of the U.S. Code states
            that a person is guilty of a felony for knowingly and willingly
            making a false or fraudulent statement to any department of the
            United States Government or subgrantees.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I understand that all information and documents provided, except as
            exempted pursuant to law, are a matter of public record, and I agree
            to provide any documentation needed to assist in determining
            eligibility.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I understand that if benefits received following receipt of ASIP
            funds are a duplication of benefits received from other sources such
            as federal benefits or charitable donations, that any subsequent
            assistance received ASIP leads will be informed and the rent subsidy
            payment will discontinue.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I authorize the ASIP lead to contact the landlord/property manager,
            employer, agencies, utility providers, and other applicable
            individuals for information about my family or myself for the
            purpose of rental assistance. This authorization includes any exempt
            or confidential information and all agencies and individuals with
            whom I have worked or may work through referral by any agency.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I understand that this authorization is considered a release. The
            release of content includes but is not limited to all information,
            including any exempt or confidential information, regarding rental
            history, rental amount, landlord information, income, employment, or
            other information needed to determine eligibility and process
            request for rental or utility assistance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I understand that if I received additional benefits (including
            charitable donations) following my receipt of ASIP funds, and those
            benefits are a duplication of the ASIP funds/benefits that I have
            already or will receive, that I will notify ASIP of the receipt of
            these benefits and that my rent subsidy payment will be discontinued
            or proportionally reduced.
